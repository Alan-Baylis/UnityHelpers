Random Notes :

To correctly add bump map via script :
material.SetTexture("_BumpMap", BumpTex);
material.EnableKeyword("_NORMALMAP");
(Some other possible keywords)
_NORMALMAP -- _BumpMap
_EMISSION -- _EmissionMap
_SPECGLOSSMAP -- _SpecGlossMap
_DETAIL_MULX2 -- _DetailAlbedoMap

To fix PBR lighting that looks washed out : 
[Window] -> [Lighting] -> Change Reflection Source from SkyBox to Custom

To set Standard Shader Values : 
material.SetFloat("_Glossiness", 0);
Keywords found by Rightclick on Inspector tab and setting to Debug and looking through Float Firsts

If ever Alpha Materials are rendering above each other :
material.renderQueue = 3000; (lower Number is below, start at 3000)

To Make sure Standard Shader is loaded with correct variants into build :
- Create Materials that use the needed variants in Resources/Materials
